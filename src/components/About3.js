          Most of our active musicians, producers and Djs, and many of us use
          Live and Push everyday. We came from a wide range of cultural and
          professional backgrounds. Some of us have phDs, some are self-taught,
          and most of us are somewhere in between. What coonects us is the
          shared beliefs that each of us has the skills and knowledge to
          contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
          culture.
